1st Approach
Linear Search
TC : O(n log n)  SC : O(1)  Not considering ArrayList
​
2nd approach
without sorting just, checking for equal to and less than target elements
TC : O(n) SC : O(1) Not considering ArrayList
​
3rd Approach
sorting the array first then,
Finding first and last occurance of target
adding index of target from first to last using for loop in list
TC : O(log n) SC :O(1) Not considering ArrayList
